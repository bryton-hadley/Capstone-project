WINTER WONDERLAND 

this website  is a front-end and back-end project that you can
post about different ski resorts and plan your own ski trip. you can pos images 
like & dislike post  you can slo add the price of the resort for a day pass ticket. eventually i would like it to be bale to show other hotels around the ski resorts so you can book a hotel room and start planning your tirp! this will also be able to look for discounts and the best time of year to go!


here is the teh main page and what it looks like:


TECHNOLOGY

JavaScript,html,css,json



FRONT-END 

in the front end of things i use a basic boilerr plate html code to get the structer of things. on the main page i used a form to crewat the post resort section of the page witch uses inputs to take in the info that the user is giving us about the ski resort. the frontend also has a section for displaying the post, the frontend also has the CSS styling linked to it as well as a link to link the frontend to the backedend.


BACK-END 

this is where all the functionality is like  axios post, put, get, and delete 
this is also where the database is where it stores all the info about the resorts, this is also where i set up the innerHTML to create a new ski resort post as well.
